        <div class="section">
          <h2>About the Energy Map</h2>
          <p>The Clean Air Task Force seeks to meet the world’s rising energy demand in a way that is financially,
            socially, and
            environmentally sustainable. As an organization that advocates for the technology and policy changes needed
            to achieve
            a zero-emissions, high-energy planet, we strive for global futures where emerging economies invest in clean
            energy.
            Specifically in sub-saharan Africa, where 80% of the world’s population without electricity lives, there
            remains a crucial gap
            in addressing the challenges and opportunities regarding energy technology deployment and readiness. The
            composite index displayed by
            this map seeks to fill a gap in existing reports by providing a comprehensive assessment of the current
            state of energy technology
            deployment in Africa while also incorporating critical factors such as country planning, potential
            resources, grid infrastructure,
            policy, and innovation.</p>

          <h2>Scoring Framework</h2>
          <p>Each dimension and subdimension is evaluated on a scale of 0-100, with higher scores indicating better
            performance:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>System Performance (0-100):</strong> Measures the current efficiency, reliability, and coverage
              of energy systems</li>
            <li><strong>Transition Readiness (0-100):</strong> Assesses preparation for transitioning to sustainable
              energy sources</li>
            <li><strong>Tech Preparedness (0-100):</strong> Evaluates technological capacity for implementing modern
              energy solutions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Subdimensions are weighted based on their relative importance to create the aggregate scores. The final
            country score is a composite of these three dimensions, providing a comprehensive assessment of each
            nation's energy transition preparedness.</p>
